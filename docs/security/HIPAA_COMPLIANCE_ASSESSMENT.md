# HIPAA Compliance Assessment & Security Checklist

**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ **Partial Compliance - Gaps Identified**
**Target:** Full HIPAA Compliance for Healthcare Environment

## Executive Summary

The MED13 Resource Library handles biomedical research data that may include Protected Health Information (PHI). This document assesses current HIPAA compliance status and identifies gaps requiring remediation.

**Current Status:** 🟡 **Partial Compliance**
- ✅ Strong foundation in place
- ⚠️ Several critical gaps identified
- 🔴 Action required before production deployment

## HIPAA Requirements Overview

HIPAA requires compliance with three main rules:
1. **Privacy Rule** - Patient rights and data use/disclosure
2. **Security Rule** - Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
3. **Breach Notification Rule** - Requirements for breach reporting

## Current Security Posture

### ✅ Strengths (Implemented)

#### 1. Authentication & Access Control
- ✅ **JWT-based authentication** with secure token management
- ✅ **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Admin, Researcher, Viewer roles
- ✅ **Password security:**
  - bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Account lockout after failed attempts
  - Secure password generation
- ✅ **Session management:**
  - Session tracking with IP address and user agent
  - Device fingerprinting
  - Session expiration
  - Automatic session cleanup

**Location:**
- `src/application/services/authentication_service.py`
- `src/application/services/authorization_service.py`
- `src/infrastructure/security/password_hasher.py`

#### 2. Audit Logging
- ✅ **Audit trail infrastructure** exists
- ✅ **AuditLog model** tracks:
  - Action type
  - Entity type and ID
  - User (actor)
  - Timestamp
  - Details (JSON)

**Location:**
- `src/models/database/audit.py`
- `src/application/services/audit_service.py`

**Status:** ✅ Implemented but needs enhancement (see gaps)

#### 3. Encryption in Transit
- ✅ **TLS enforcement** for database connections in production/staging
- ✅ **HTTPS required** via CSP headers (`upgrade-insecure-requests`)
- ✅ **Database SSL mode** automatically enforced (`sslmode=require`)

**Location:**
- `src/database/url_resolver.py` - `_enforce_tls_requirements()`
- `src/web/next.config.js` - CSP headers

#### 4. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection
- ✅ **Rate limiting middleware** implemented
- ✅ **Endpoint-specific limits** (GET: 200/20s, POST: 50/5s, DELETE: 20/2s)
- ✅ **Distributed rate limiting** via Redis (optional)
- ✅ **IP-based tracking** for brute force prevention

**Location:**
- `src/middleware/rate_limit.py`
- `src/middleware/distributed_rate_limit.py`

#### 5. Security Headers
- ✅ **Content Security Policy (CSP)** configured
- ✅ **X-Frame-Options: DENY** (prevents clickjacking)
- ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
- ✅ **Strict-Transport-Security** (HSTS)
- ✅ **Referrer-Policy** configured

**Location:**
- `src/web/next.config.js`

#### 6. Input Validation
- ✅ **Pydantic models** for all API inputs
- ✅ **Type safety** (100% MyPy compliance)
- ✅ **SQL injection prevention** via SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ **XSS prevention** via DOMPurify utilities

**Location:**
- Domain entities use Pydantic
- `src/web/lib/security/sanitize.ts`
