# MED13 Foundation Design Guidelines

## Design Philosophy: Family-First Modernity

The MED13 Foundation's design centers on **families, connection, and shared hope** rather than clinical institutions. The visual language should feel **warm, uplifting, and trustworthy** - communicating that this is a place built by and for families navigating MED13 syndrome together.

**Design Tone Keywords:**
💞 *Warm • Inclusive • Trustworthy • Hopeful • Connected • Human-Centered*

## Color System - "Warm Science + Family Hope"

The palette evokes optimism, empathy, and clarity - balancing medical trust with human warmth.

**Primary Palette:**

- **Text** `#2E2E2E` (HSL: 0 0% 18%) - Readable, modern contrast
- **Muted** Soft neutral grays for secondary information

**Color Usage:**
- Avoid harsh medical blues or greys

## Layout & Structure

**Goal:** Balance storytelling with action, create calm rhythm.

**Key Principles:**
- Maximum section width: 1100-1200px for optimal readability
- Generous padding: 80-100px between sections (py-16 to py-24)
- Use asymmetric grid sections where appropriate (alternating photo/text)
- Soft dividers: Faint gradient lines or curved section breaks
- Replace dense lists with icon cards (rounded corners, pastel backgrounds)

**Cards & Components:**
- Clean white cards with subtle elevation
- 6-8px border radius for gentle, approachable feel
- Semi-transparent cards (bg-card/95) with backdrop blur over background images
- Icon + Title + Description pattern
- Hover: Subtle elevation increase using hover-elevate utility

## Motion & Interaction - "Subtle Emotional Reinforcement"

**Goal:** Enhance without distracting.

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Button hover: Gentle lift + slight color warmth (handled by built-in utilities)
- Section reveal: Fade-in + upward motion on scroll (0.3-0.4s ease)
- Smooth scroll behavior for anchor navigation
- Background parallax on hero for subtle depth

**DO:**
✅ Subtle, meaningful animations
✅ Focus on accessibility (keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast)

**DON'T:**
🚫 Excessive motion or distracting effects
🚫 Auto-playing carousels or videos

## Iconography - "Simple, Rounded, Emotionally Resonant"

**Style:** Duotone line icons with rounded corners (Lucide icons)

**Themes:**
- 🧬 Research → DNA strand in teal
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Family → Coral heart + people silhouettes
- 🤝 Collaboration → Interlocking circles
- 💡 Discovery → Sunlight yellow bulb
- 📊 Data → Chart/graph in teal


## Accessibility Requirements

- WCAG AA contrast ratios minimum (4.5:1 for body text)
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Semantic HTML throughout
- Alt text for all images
- Form labels explicitly associated
- Skip to content link

## Critical Design Principles

1. **Family-First**: Design communicates "built by families, for families"
2. **Warmth with Trust**: Balance emotional connection with credibility
3. **Clarity Above All**: Every element serves understanding
4. **Accessible Always**: Families in vulnerable moments need barrier-free access
5. **Hope and Optimism**: Visual language inspires rather than intimidates
6. **Human-Centered**: People before processes, connection before clinical

---

**Result:** Visitors instantly feel *this is a place built by and for families*, not a distant research entity. The design bridges the scientific rigor of medical research with the warmth and humanity of family support.
