# **MED13 Curation Dashboard – User Experience Design Overview**

## **1. Purpose & Vision**

The MED13 Curation Dashboard is designed as a **clinical reasoning workspace**, not a data-management tool. Its goal is to make variant and phenotype curation intuitive, visually clear, and scientifically rigorous. The interface turns evidence evaluation into an engaging, traceable process that reflects MED13 Foundation’s guiding UX principle:

> **“Scientific clarity with human warmth.”**

This means every interaction should balance precision, provenance, and empathy — supporting expert clinicians, curators, and data scientists alike.

---

## **2. Core UX Objectives**

### **Clarity and Focus**

* Prioritize context-rich information instead of raw IDs and codes.
* Use visual hierarchy (cards, tabs, badges) to guide expert attention.

### **Efficiency and Flow**

* Reduce cognitive load by using **progressive disclosure** — users see summaries first, then expand details as needed.
* Minimize clicks with clear default views and pre-filtered queues.

### **Transparency and Trust**

* Embed **provenance trails** and confidence indicators at every level.
* All decisions are auditable, logged, and reversible.

### **Empathy and Accessibility**

* Inclusive color palette (MED13 reds, teals, neutrals) and language that’s collaborative, not punitive (“Send for review” instead of “Reject”).
* WCAG AA compliant visuals and bilingual readiness (English/Spanish).

---

## **3. Core Interface Components**

### **A. Variant Review Cards (Queue View)**

Replaces static tables with **clinical review cards** displaying essential information:

* Variant ID, gene, and confidence score at a glance.
* Phenotype badges (HPO terms) and evidence pills summarizing source counts.
* Quick actions: *Approve*, *Send for Review*, *Flag for Discussion*.

Hovering expands each card to show an evidence preview without navigating away. This allows curators to triage rapidly.

### **B. Multi-Panel Clinical Viewer**

When a variant is selected, users enter a **tabbed evidence viewer**:

* **Summary Tab** – overview of significance, confidence, and source counts.
* **Evidence Analysis** – side-by-side matrix comparing ClinVar, Orphanet, and internal curation.
* **Phenotype Associations** – frequency and co-occurrence heatmaps.
* **Literature** – linked PubMed abstracts with highlight excerpts.
* **Conflict Resolution** – timeline of conflicting interpretations with decision tools.

Each tab is self-contained and lazy-loaded to improve performance.

### **C. Conflict Resolution Panel**

A dedicated panel highlights discrepancies:

* Color-coded conflict badges (red, yellow, orange) indicate disagreement level.
* Each conflict includes source details and evidence summary.
* Users can choose resolution paths: *Accept*, *Override*, or *Flag for Expert Review*.
* A **Conflict Timeline** shows when discrepancies arose and were resolved.

### **D. Expert Annotation & Audit Drawer**

A right-hand drawer tracks expert commentary and logs every action:

* Annotation form for rationale, supporting references, and confidence override.
* Each note becomes a permanent part of the variant’s audit trail.
* Activity timeline shows who made which decision and when.

### **E. Smart Queue Filters**

A collapsible filter accordion enables precise triage:

* Filter by significance (pathogenic, uncertain, benign).
* Set thresholds for confidence and evidence level.
* Filter by phenotype or conflict status.
* A “My Queue” view shows cases assigned to the current curator.

### **F. Analytics & Progress Dashboard**

A top-level dashboard provides feedback loops:

* Progress gauge (variants reviewed vs. pending).
* Conflict resolution rate and curator workload metrics.
* Recent activities and pending high-priority items.

| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Pathogenic                | #C0392B                                 | Red – high severity    |
| Likely Benign             | #1ABC9C                                 | Teal – safe zone       |
| Uncertain                 | #F1C40F                                 | Gold – requires review |
| Confidence (High/Med/Low) | Green/Yellow/Red                        | Gauge clarity          |
| Typography                | Inter (sans-serif), Lora (serif titles) | Readability + trust    |

### **Layout Principles**

* **Grid-based structure** with high whitespace ratio for focus.
* **Cards over tables** – visual summaries instead of dense data grids.
* **Responsive design** – optimized for 13” laptops and tablets.

### **Component Architecture**

```python
# Proposed component structure for implementation
src/presentation/dash/components/curation/
├── clinical_card.py          # Review card component
├── evidence_matrix.py        # Comparison matrix
├── conflict_panel.py         # Resolution interface
├── annotation_drawer.py      # Expert notes
├── confidence_gauge.py       # Visual confidence meter
└── progress_analytics.py     # Dashboard metrics
```

### **Enhanced Data Visualizations**

#### **Evidence Strength Heatmap**
```python
def create_evidence_heatmap():
    """Visualize evidence strength across multiple dimensions"""
    return go.Figure(data=go.Heatmap(
        z=[[1, 0.8, 0.6], [0.9, 1, 0.4], [0.7, 0.5, 1]],
        x=['ClinVar', 'PubMed', 'Internal'],
        y=['Pathogenic', 'Uncertain', 'Benign'],
        colorscale='RdYlGn'
    ))
```

#### **Conflict Detection Specificity**
- **Inter-source conflicts** (ClinVar vs PubMed)
- **Intra-source conflicts** (multiple ClinVar submissions)
- **Temporal conflicts** (evidence evolution over time)
- **Methodological conflicts** (functional vs population studies)

### **Layout Principles**
* **Grid-based structure** with high whitespace ratio for focus.
* **Cards over tables** – visual summaries instead of dense data grids.
* **Responsive design** – optimized for 13" laptops and tablets.
* **Mobile optimization** – tablet support for field/clinic curation with touch interactions.

## **8. Integration with Phase 0 Architecture**

* **Framework:** Plotly Dash + Bootstrap Components matches existing tech stack.
* **Backend:** FastAPI endpoints extend current architecture for clinical data retrieval.
* **Frontend:** Embedded seamlessly under `med13foundation.org/curation` (Next.js shell).
* **Security:** OAuth2/SSO authentication with JWT-based role enforcement.
* **Logging:** Every curator interaction logged to `/api/audit/log` in real time.
* **External Integrations:** Direct links to genome browsers (UCSC, Ensembl), variant databases (gnomAD, ClinVar), and literature tools (PubMed, Google Scholar).

This integration ensures curation stays modular, secure, and maintainable while sharing a unified brand experience.

---

## **9. Accessibility & Internationalization**

* **WCAG AA** compliant color contrast and keyboard navigation.
* **Spanish localization** (`react-intl` and Dash translation hooks) for bilingual inclusivity.
* **Screen-reader-friendly labels** on all buttons and charts.
* **Tablet optimization** for field work and clinical settings with touch-based interactions.

---

## **10. Emotional Design & User Empowerment**

* **Confidence Meter:** Converts abstract statistics into emotional reassurance for curators.
* **Conflict Resolution Animation:** Glows softly when evidence conflicts are reconciled, symbolizing scientific progress.
* **Progress Bar:** Reinforces community impact ("80% of MED13 variants reviewed this quarter").
* **Tone of Voice:** Encouraging and human ("Ready for expert review") instead of judgmental ("Incomplete data").
* **Expert Validation:** Visual feedback when clinical decisions align with evidence strength.
